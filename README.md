# mdt

A fast, terminal-based markdown viewer and editor built with Rust.

**[Documentation](https://mdt.purbayan.me/)**

Point `mdt` at a directory and you get a file tree, a fully rendered markdown preview, a built-in editor with vim-style keybindings, and a live split-pane preview that updates as you type. It renders headings, code blocks with syntax highlighting, tables, task lists, blockquotes, and more, all inside your terminal.

## Features

**File browser**

- Collapsible file tree with directory navigation
- File search/filter that narrows the tree as you type
- Toggle the file tree on or off with `Ctrl+e`
- File management: create, delete, rename, and move files and directories
- Nested path creation (e.g. `abc/def/notes.md`)
- Fuzzy file finder to quickly jump to any file
- File watching with automatic reload when files change on disk

**Markdown preview**

- Headings (H1 through H6) with distinct color and weight
- Bold, italic, and strikethrough text
- Inline code with background highlighting
- Fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting (powered by syntect)
- Code blocks rendered with box-drawing borders
- Ordered and unordered lists with proper nesting
- Hanging indents on wrapped list continuation lines
- Task lists with checkbox rendering (unchecked/checked)
- Blockquotes with vertical bar indicators, including nested blockquotes
- Tables with box-drawing borders and bold headers
- Horizontal rules
- Links with a searchable link picker overlay
- Autolinks
- Scrollbar that appears when content exceeds the viewport
- Heading jump navigation (`[` / `]`)
- Inline images: `![alt](path)` is drawn with the terminal's graphics (kitty, sixel, iTerm2) or as unicode half-blocks elsewhere; `Ctrl+i` / `:images` turns them off, `--no-images` never asks
- [quine](https://github.com/indeterminacy/homunculus) link lines (`—links-to→ Name [id kind]` items under `## Links out` / `## Links in`) painted like quine's triage: relationship bold yellow, name bold, id cyan, `[dangling]` red, what was said on the edge hung in italic

**Editor**

- Built-in text editor with vim-style keybindings
- Insert and Normal modes
- Dirty-file tracking with unsaved-changes warnings
- Save, save-and-quit, and force-quit commands
- Reload file from disk with `:e` / `:edit` command

**Live preview**

- Real-time split-pane preview that updates as you type
- Horizontal (editor left, preview right) and vertical (editor top, preview bottom) split modes
- Debounced rendering to keep editing responsive
- Parallel scrolling between editor and preview panes
- Toggle with `Ctrl+p` or the `:preview` command
- Swap split orientation with `Ctrl+s`

**Search**

- In-document search with match count and navigation
- File tree search that filters entries in real time
- Wrapping match navigation (n/N)

**Terminal integration**

- Mouse support: scroll wheel to scroll, click to switch panes, click a link to open it
- Width-aware text wrapping for paragraphs, headings, blockquotes, and lists
- Code block and table truncation for narrow terminals
- Terminal background color detection (prevents transparency bleed)
- `NO_COLOR` environment variable support
- Dirty-flag rendering (only redraws when something changes)
- Pre-warmed syntax highlighting on a background thread
- Advisory file locking to prevent concurrent instance conflicts
- Welcome screen with ASCII art logo
- Help overlay and link picker modal
- Panic-safe terminal teardown

## Installation

Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/mdtui):

```
cargo install mdtui
```

Or build from source:

```
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/mdt`.

## Usage

```
mdt [path] [--max-file-size <bytes>] [--max-width <columns>]
```

Opens the given directory, or opens the given file with the file tree rooted at its directory. Defaults to the current directory if no path is provided.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--max-file-size <bytes>` | Maximum file size to open (default: 5 MB) |
| `--max-width <columns>` | Maximum render width in columns; also `MDT_MAX_WIDTH` env var (default: terminal width) |
| `--no-images` | Don't draw images, show `[image: alt]` instead; also `MDT_NO_IMAGES=1` |

When `mdt` starts, you'll see the welcome screen. Press `Ctrl+e` to open the file tree, navigate to a markdown file, and press `Enter` to preview it.
